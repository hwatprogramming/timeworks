                        <h1>Introduction</h1>
                        <p>This is the first programming project that I am undertaking as a beginner self taught programmer. I am learning progamming from zero so this program will not be perfect.<p>
                        <p>This generator is designed based on my personal experience and may not cater to all the schedules in the world.</p>
                        <p>If you have a schedule that isn't able to be generated by this software, feel free to drop me an email and I will see how I can tweek it to your specifications. No Guarantee.</p>
                        <p>If you are unsure of how to use this schedule generator, do refer to the tutorial or drop me an email and I will try to create a schedule for you. No Guarantee.</p>

                        <h1>The Idea</h1>
                        <p>Before starting, I have decided that this software should be useable from both mobile and PC and have settled on web to build my program.</p>
                        <p>I have also thought about offline usage but I am not experienced enough to know what framework to use for my program.</p>
                        <p>The program is spilt up into 5 parts: Input, Generate, Scan, Score, Sort/Filter, Export</p>

                        <h1>Part 1: Getting Information</h1>
                                <p>The required information to generate a schedule are: shift details, worker details, requirements, limitations and preferences</p>
                                <p>A form will be used to gather required information from the user</p>
                                <p>I have thought about 2 methods for acquiring information(User Interface): Sentence Forming and/or Graphical Input</p>
                                <p>User will be prompted with an option to create a new schedule or load an existing .json settings file</p>
                                <p>If user selects new, a default .json file will be parse through and stored in Javascript</p>
                                <p>If user selects load, Javascript will verifiy if it is a valid file then if valis, the .json file will be parse through and stored in Javascript</p>

                                <h2>Details of all the information to be acquired</h2>

                                <h3>Day or Month</h3>
                                <li>There will be an option to choose between generating a hourly schedule for 24 hours or a monthly schedule</li>

                                <h3>Shift Details</h3>
                                    <li>All Shift Types</li>
                                    <li>Shift Name</li>
                                    <li>Shift Abbreviation</li>
                                    <li>Shift Duration</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Each shift must be a factor of 24(for OCD's sake)</li>
                                            <li>Each shift must be a multiple of the shortest shift duration(for OCD's sake)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <li>Shift Start Time(for fixed time shifts)</li>
                                    <li>Shift Description</li>

                                <h3>Worker Details</h3>
                                <li>Worker Name</li>
                                <li>Worker Name Abbreviation(to be displayed in schedule)</li>
                                <li>Worker Rank/Position/Type</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Example: Fulltimer, Partimer.. to make it easier to input what each rank can/cannot do</li>
                                        <li>Input X Workers work Y days/hours. Z Workers work B days/hours. C Workers work D days/hours. Calculate the amount of rest they have</li>
                                        <li>Or..Input X Workers work Y times as much as Z Workers, X Workers work B times as much as C Workers and calculate the amount of rest they have</li>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>This is to determine the rest ratio/multiplier of rest factor for each type of worker</li>
                                                <li>For Example: Partimers work 10 days and Fulltimers work 20 days in a 30-day month</li>
                                                <li>Partimers Rest 20 days and Fulltimers rest 10 days in a 30-day month</li>
                                                <li>Thus, the rest days of fulltimers are worth twice as much as a partimer.</li>
                                                <li>This is to balance the working hours of each worker type.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                    </ul>
                                <li>Worker Team & tagging</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Example: Team A, Team B... to make it easier to assign the dates that each team will be working</li>    
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3>Requirements</h3>
                                        <li>This will be implemented by creating sentences or graphically(if I can figure out how).</li>
                                        <li>Planner will also be able to add notes for each statement</li>
                                        <li>Example for month schedule: Every day must have X amount of Y shifts</li>
                                        <li>Example for month schedule: Every day must have A amount of B shifts</li>
                                        <li>Example for month schedule*(situational): Day C must have D amount of E shifts</li>
                                        <li>Example for day schedule: Every hour must have X amount of Y shifts</li>
                                        <li>Example for day schedule: Every hour must have A amount of B shifts</li>
                                        <li>Example: Day X to Day Y, Worker/Worker Type Z must do A shift</li>    
                                    <h3>Anti-requirements</h3>
                                        <li>This will be implemented by creating sentences or graphically(if I can figure out how).</li>
                                        <li>Planner will also be able to add notes for each statement</li>
                                        <li>Example: Day X to Day Y, Worker Z must not do A shift. (on leave/schooling,recovering,sick...)</li>
                                        <li>Exmaple: Worker/Worker Type Z(Fulltimer/Partimer) cannot do Y work on day X, hour A (only for month planner), too complicated </li>
                                        <li>Exmaple: Worker/Worker Type Z(Team) cannot do Y work on hour A </li>
                                    
                                
                            <h1>Part 2: Generating all possible combinations</h1>
                            <p>The software will take in the information and generate based on the requirements and limitations.</p>
                                 <li>Permuations of multisets</li>
                                 <li>Arrays</li>
                                <li>2D Arrays</li>
                            <h1>Part 3: Scanning and scoring the combination</h1>
                            <p>There are 2 components to this: scanning and sorting</p>
                            <p>The scanning portion will make use of a combing system that looks for certain patterns</p>
                            <p>The scoring portion will detect a certain pattern and assign points accordingly</p>
                            <p>The scoring will also use standard deviation and variance to generate a balanced score across the workers for some factors.</p>
                            <p>There are 5 factors that I have thought of to score every schedule combination by:</p>
                                <li>Rest Score: Amount and quality of rest</li>
                                <li>Shift Change/Pattern Score: Worker's preference for certain shift patterns</li>
                                <li>Shift Score: Worker's preference for certain shift</li>
                                <li>Relaibility Score: How often a reliable senior is available</li>
                                <li>Replaceability Score: How easy it is to replace someone on a particular day</li>
                            <p>These are the 5 factors explained in the way that I imagined it in my head.</p>
                            <li>Shift Score: Worker's preference for certain shift</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>detects shifts that workers like and gives 1 point</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Shift Change/Pattern Score: Worker's preference for certain shift patterns</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>detects shift patterns that workers like and gives 1 point</li>
                                <li>detects shift patterns that workers hate and deduct 1 point</li>
                                <li>detects improbable shift patterns that workers and discards the combination(i should program this into the generator instead)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The program will rank the schedule combinations via a default order(Rest to Pattern to Shift to Reliability to Replaceability). The user can also change the order or sorting.</p>
                            <p>There will also be a blank schedule to allow user input to find a pattern that matches his input.</p>
